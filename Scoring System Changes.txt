# Summary of Scoring System Changes

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Strictness Factor Applied: **0.85x** (15% reduction)
- **Removed**: 110% confidence boosting from pronunciation and confidence
- **Applied**: 85% strictness multiplier across all metrics
- **Result**: Scores now typically 15-25 points lower, making 90%+ achievements more challenging

### 2. Clarity → Confidence Metric Transformation
**Old Clarity**: Based purely on Deepgram confidence scores  
**New Confidence**: 
- **70% weight**: Sentiment analysis (-1 to +1 mapped to confidence levels)
- **30% weight**: Word usage indicators (confident phrases vs hesitation words)
- **Examples**: "definitely", "absolutely" boost score; "um", "maybe" reduce it

### 3. Sentiment Integration into Fluency
- **Main calculation**: Still based on WPM (55%) and pause analysis (35%)
- **Sentiment influence**: 10% weighting with small modifier (0.95x to 1.05x)
- **Logic**: Negative sentiment may indicate hesitation, affecting speech flow

### 4. Maintained Metrics
- **Pronunciation**: Stricter scoring but same confidence-based logic
- **Vocabulary Range**: Stricter scoring but unchanged diversity/complexity analysis
- **Overall**: Still simple average of the 4 scores

## Scoring Impact Examples
- **Previous**: Deepgram 95% confidence → 104 score (capped at 100)
- **Current**: Deepgram 95% confidence → 81 score (95% × 0.85 = 80.75)

## Graduated Scoring Clarification
The ranges map stricter internal calculations to user-friendly score bands, making achievements more meaningful whilst maintaining the 0-100 scale users expect.
